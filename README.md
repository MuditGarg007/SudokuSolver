**Sudoku Solver in Java**

This repository contains a simple Sudoku Solver implemented in Java.

### About Sudoku Solver

Sudoku Solver is a Java program designed to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently. Sudoku is a logic-based number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

### Features

- **Solving:** The solver employs a backtracking algorithm to find a solution for the Sudoku puzzle.
- **Input:** Sudoku puzzles can be provided as input in the form of a 9x9 grid with digits (0 for empty cells).
- **Output:** The solver outputs the solved Sudoku grid.


### Acknowledgments

- This implementation is inspired by various Sudoku solving algorithms available online.
- Thanks to the contributors of the project.
